# FinalYearProject
IoT based prediction of stress using machine learning techniques
First make connections of arduino board and pulsesensor according to the pins which are mentioned in Nammacode.ino
And next upload the code to Ardino UNO board
Next run the temp.py for generating resting heartbeat of a person and sending to firebase
Next same way run untitled0.py for generating exercising heartbeat and sending it to firebase
Note that after running each of the above .py scripts hold pulse sensor until you see 5 heartbeats on the console
After that run the tt1.py script for applying machine learning algorithms and predicting stress level
Pre requisites:
Arduino IDE,
Spyder(For executing python scripts)
